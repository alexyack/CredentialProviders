// SetSerialization takes the kind of buffer that you would normally return to LogonUI for

// GetSerialization is implement by a credential and serializes that credential.  Instead,
// SetSerialization takes the serialization and uses it to create a tile.
//
// SetSerialization is called for two main scenarios.  The first scenario is in the credui case
// where it is prepopulating a tile with credentials that the user chose to store in the OS.
// The second situation is in a remote logon case where the remote client may wish to 
// prepopulate a tile with a username, or in some cases, completely populate the tile and
// use it to logon without showing any UI.
//
// If you wish to see an example of SetSerialization, please see either the SampleCredentialProvider
// sample or the SampleCredUICredentialProvider sample.  [The logonUI team says, "The original sample that
// this was built on top of didn't have SetSerialization.  And when we decided SetSerialization was
// important enough to have in the sample, it ended up being a non-trivial amount of work to integrate
// it into the main sample.  We felt it was more important to get these samples out to you quickly than to
// hold them in order to do the work to integrate the SetSerialization changes from SampleCredentialProvider
