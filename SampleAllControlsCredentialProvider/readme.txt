Overview
--------
This sample implements a simple credential provider that uses each UI field type.

How to run this sample
--------------------------------
Once you have built the project, copy SampleAllControlsCredentialProvider.dll to the
System32 directory on a Vista machine and run Register.reg from an elevated command prompt.
The credential should appear the next time a logon is invoked (such as logging off or rebooting).

What this sample demonstrates
-----------------------------
This sample demonstrates the use of each of the nine different UI field types.

Parts of the sample
-------------------
common.h - sets up what a tile looks like and how each of the UI controls will be displayed.
CSampleCredential.h/CSampleCredential.cpp - implements ICredentialProviderCredential, which describes one tile.
CSampleProvider.h/CSampleProvider.cpp - implements ICredentialProvider, which is the main interface used by LogonUI
										to talk to a credential provider.
Dll.h/Dll.cpp - standard dll setup for a dll that implements COM objects
helpers.h/helpers.cpp - useful functionality to deal with serializing credentials, UNICODE_STRING's, etc.
