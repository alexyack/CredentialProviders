// CSampleProvider implements ICredentialProvider, which is the main
// interface that logonUI uses to decide which tiles to display.
// In this sample, we have decided to show two tiles, one for
// Administrator and one for Guest.  You will need to decide what
// tiles make sense for your situation.  Can you enumerate the
// users who will use your method to log on?  Or is it better
// to provide a tile where they can type in their username?
// Does the user need to interact with something other than the
// keyboard before you can recognize which user it is (such as insert 
// a smartcard)?  We call these "event driven" credential providers.  
// We suggest that such credential providers first provide one basic tile which
// tells the user what to do ("insert your smartcard").  Once the
// user performs the action, then you can callback into LogonUI to
// tell it that you have new tiles, and include a tile that is specific
// to the user that the user can then interact with if necessary.

// SetSerialization takes the kind of buffer that you would normally return to LogonUI for
// an authentication attempt.  It's the opposite of ICredentialProviderCredential::GetSerialization.
// GetSerialization is implemented by a credential and serializes that credential.  Instead,
// SetSerialization takes the serialization and uses it to create a tile.
//
// SetSerialization is called for two main scenarios.  The first scenario is in the credui case, which
// we'll talk about in greater detail in a bit.  The second situation is in a remote logon case 
// where the remote client may wish to prepopulate a tile with a username, or in some cases, 
// completely populate the tile and use it to logon without showing any UI.  In this scenario,
// typically the remote logon software would also come with a filter that would direct the
// remote logon to the correct credential provider.
//
// This sample shows some advanced uses of SetSerialization in the CPUS_CREDUI scenario.
//  - if the in-cred's auth package is different than the auth package that we support, we 
//      don't want to enumerate any tiles (since we can't provide creds that match the auth
//      package the caller is requesting).  So we return a special return code from SetSerialization
//      that tells it we don't want it to call GetCredentialCount on us.
//  - Even if we can handle the auth package, both smartcards and username/password use our same
//      auth package.  So we need to look at the MessageType to know if smartcard creds are
//      being requested.  If they are, then we can't serialize a tile from this info.
//  - as long as CREDUIWIN_IN_CRED_ONLY is NOT specified, we enumerate our normal tiles, plus
//      an extra with the info from the in-cred specified (as long as we can handle the auth 
//      package).
//  - if CREDUIWIN_IN_CRED_ONLY is specified (and we can handle the auth package and message type), 
//      then only enumerate a tile with the info from the in-cred filled into it and no other tiles.
//  There are a few other credui scenarios that are not shown in this sample.  Depending on your
//  purpose in writing a credprov that handles CPUS_CREDUI, you may or may not wish to handle those
//  scenarios.  We suggest you read the technical references about the CREDUIWIN_* flags
//  for additional information.
