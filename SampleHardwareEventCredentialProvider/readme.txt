Overview
--------
This sample implements a hardware event credential provider. In this scenario, the hardware
event (connect/disconnect) is emulated by a window button toggle. 

How to run this sample
--------------------------------
Once you have built the project, copy SampleHardwareEventCredentialProvider.dll to a Vista 
machine's System32 directory and run register.reg from an elevated command prompt. The 
credential should appear the next time a logon is invoked (such as when switching users).

What this sample demonstrates
-----------------------------
This sample demonstrates how to handle asynchronous events by updating UI shown in logonUI for your credential provider.
